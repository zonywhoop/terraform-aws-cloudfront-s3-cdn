[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn/releases).



For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

```hcl
module "cdn" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn.git?ref=master"
  namespace        = "eg"
  stage            = "prod"
  name             = "app"
  aliases          = ["assets.cloudposse.com"]
  parent_zone_name = "cloudposse.com"
}
```

### Generating ACM Certificate

Use the AWS cli to [request new ACM certifiates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request.html) (requires email validation)
```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --subject-alternative-names a.example.com b.example.com *.c.example.com
```



__NOTE__:

Although AWS Certificate Manager is supported in many AWS regions, to use an SSL certificate with CloudFront, it should be requested only in US East (N. Virginia) region.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-requirements.html
> If you want to require HTTPS between viewers and CloudFront, you must change the AWS region to US East (N. Virginia) in the AWS Certificate Manager console before you request or import a certificate.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-regions.html
> To use an ACM Certificate with Amazon CloudFront, you must request or import the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. ACM Certificates in this region that are associated with a CloudFront distribution are distributed to all the geographic locations configured for that distribution.

This is a fundamental requirement of CloudFront, and you will need to request the certificate in `us-east-1` region.

If there are warnings around the outputs when destroying using this module.
Then you can use this method for supressing the superfluous errors.
`TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS=1 terraform destroy`
